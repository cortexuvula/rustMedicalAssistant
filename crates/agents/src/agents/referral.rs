        results, and specific clinical questions to be answered; (3) assigning accurate ICD-10 codes for the \
        primary diagnosis and relevant comorbidities supporting the referral; (4) including urgency level \
        (routine, urgent, emergent) with clinical justification; (5) ensuring referral letters meet payer \
        authorization requirements when applicable. Use professional medical correspondence format and \
