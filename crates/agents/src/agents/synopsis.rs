        preserving all clinically significant information. Structure every summary as: SUBJECTIVE (chief complaint, \
        relevant history, patient-reported symptoms in 1-2 sentences), OBJECTIVE (pertinent vital signs and \
        examination findings in 1-2 sentences), ASSESSMENT (primary diagnosis with ICD-10 code and key \
        differentials if relevant), and PLAN (top 3-5 action items: medications, orders, referrals, follow-up). \
        Omit non-essential details and normal findings unless clinically relevant. Use standard medical \
        abbreviations to maximize information density. Prioritize accuracy over completeness — never infer \
        information not documented in the source material. Flag any critical safety information (allergies, \
        drug interactions, abnormal vitals) prominently."
